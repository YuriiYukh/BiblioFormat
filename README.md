# BiblioFormat
Tthe essence is this: we set a DOI or a list of DOIs (see examples list_doi.txt or a larger list_doi_2.txt list), the program requests a bibliography from the Internet and formats the bibliography for us as we need. There are three main files, modules: main_convert_refer - launch file; gui_test - GUI; class_ref_conv - direct work with files and text
